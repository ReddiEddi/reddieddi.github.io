## HTML

HTML is all one needs to design a webpage. It has basic functionalities such as displaying texts, ordered and unordered lists, tables and links among other elements. It is, however not recommended to only use HTML for a website as the final outcome will be very basic and old-fashioned, so it is recommended to use CSS alongside HTML for a better visual result (Ajini, 2015, p. 7).

The main elements of HTML in websites are the \<head> and \<body> elements located within the \<html> element of a website. The \<html> element encompasses everything in the website from displayed texts to functions (Larsen, 2013, p. 9) Without it, there would be no website to display. The element always starts and ends with an opening and closing tag respectively. The \<body> element always opens with the <body> tag and ends with the \</body> tag, with any content for the \<body> being written between the tags (W3Schools, n.d.). You can observe this on this website’s code by right-clicking and clicking ‘inspect element’ on chromium-based browsers.

In the \<head> is next to nothing written which one can read (you can read the website’s title in the browser tab) since it contains information about this site (Larsen, 2013, p. 9). These are scripts such as JavaScript, but also the websites stylesheet from a separate CSS file. Everything within it is visible as it defines much of the websites style and functions, but it is all hidden at the same time.

The \<body> section contains all the visible information including texts, sections, buttons, and images (Larsen, 2013, p. 9). Most of the code will be in this section. This website has been divided into multiple sections via headings. These are written with the \<h1> or \<h2> tag depending on the required size and relevance for the content (Ajini, 2015, p. 29). This \<h2> section had a few buttons above which load different Markdown files. This piece of text itself is not in the HTML code, but it loads it from a separate file, thus it is still needed to display this content. Other sections in this website have an API and an image and more, all loaded via HTML, but some elements cannot be done with HTML alone, hence why this website loads markdown files via JavaScript for instance.
