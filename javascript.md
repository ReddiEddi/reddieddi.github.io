## JavaScript

JavaScript is a separate programming language which can be used in HTML as a means to perform various functions. These functions include reading elements from and adding elements into documents, change and alter text on a website, and react when the user presses a button depending on which function has been programmed (Larsen, 2013, p. 214). 

JavaScript is being used in this website as well for two functions. The scripts can be seen within the \<script> element between the closing \</body> and \</html> tags. The first one is to load the various markdown files with all the content (including this one), and the second one is to load the Random Fox API as seen above on the website.
