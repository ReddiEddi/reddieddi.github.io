## GitHub

If you are reading this, you have hopefully accessed this website via GitHub. If you didn’t, then it is impressive that you managed to find this website. In any case, here is a brief explanation of what Github is.

A simple definition of GitHub is that it ‘is a platform that hosts code, providing version control and collaboration features. It enables you and others to work together on projects from anywhere in the world’ (Opoku, 2024). It is a service which has public repositories for different pieces of free and open-source software (FOSS) where anyone can make a piece of code or software and upload it to their cloud-based servers. Users are encouraged to do this and even to edit each other’s codes via branching for improvement or bug fixes, after which the forks can be merged if needed (GitHub, 2022). When it comes to uploading a product to GitHub, one would create a repository (repo), upload files, and make it available to the public. It also had the advantage of single files being edited without having to complicate the process of removing old files to replace them with new ones. Instead, one will push a change to a file, and then commit the said change to the repo along with a changelog (Opoku, 2024). Since everyone has access to GitHub, many pieces of code or software have even been used in bigger projects.

A small piece of software, which can be highlighted as an example, is a browser extension called 10ten Japanese Reader (Free Software Foundation, 2025). Japanese has three writing systems. Two of these have 46 different characters each (called *hiragana* and *katakana*) and can be used to write the entire Japanese language, but without any context it is difficult to know what is meant due to the frequency of homophones. The third writing system (called *kanji*) solves this challenge, but there are officially 2,136 characters in common use (Hasegawa, 2014, pp. 43-57). As an example, the Japanese word さん (*san*, written in *hiragana*) can be a suffix used after a person's name when written in *hiragana*, but *kanji* can apply a different meaning such as 三 (three), 山 (mountain), or 酸 (acid), all of which can have the same reading (さん, *san*).

*Kanji* is a benefit when reading out of context, but the downside is that one will have to learn to read all over again, except that therer are more than 2000 characters compared to the 25-30 letter any alphabets have. The 10Ten software helps many learners of Japanese with this reading aid as it can both display readings, different writings, verb and adjective conjugations, pitch accent and how common the word or phrase is. It also has the functionality to convert Japanese units of measurement, currency, and calendar, and it can do all of this by simply hovering over a given word in the website (Free Software Foundation, 2025). This was merely a small browser extension, but what has been shared in other repos on GitHub can be uses for much bigger projects. According to GitHub themselves, code on their platform has even been used in missions on Mars (GitHub, 2022).

This website has been uploaded to GitHub for other people to see, and for any creator to play around with it. Given the insignificance of this website with mere basic code, not many changes will happen, nor is to be expected. It is, however, good to know that the possibility exists. If you are reading this, this means that one or several commits to this website have been pushed. Hopefully, you have also been able to read all other sections which have been pushed as separate markdown files. If you haven’t, try clicking one of the other buttons above.
