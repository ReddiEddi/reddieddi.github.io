## Markdown

Markdown, described by its creator ‘is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers’ (Gruber, n.d.). The syntax is very similar to HTML, but very simplified. For instance, to make headings in HTML, one would write \<h1> [heading 1 text] \</h1> whereas it would be written in markdown as # [heading 1 text]. \<h2> would be written as ## and so on. The syntax may be different, but the output will still be the same (Lahoti, 2021). Whether one decides to write in markdown or in HTML is ultimately up to preference in most cases.

Markdown files have been used in this website to display larger chunks of text. This very piece of text has been loaded from a markdown file along with all other texts that will be displayed by clicking a button on the website. The advantage is that if there, for instance, needs to be added a new paragraph or a section needs revising, one does not have to dig though the code to amend the text. One would instead edit the markdown file. Once it has been committed, the website will load the updated markdown file with the new text without the programmer ever having to touch the HTML code.
